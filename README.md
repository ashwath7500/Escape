Our Idea is to develope a tech which helps the user to locate and reach the nearest Secure place.
We are going to use ML to predict whether a place is safe using the satellite image of the same in the real time.
We also get the inputs from users who convey about their status i.e whether they are safe or not
So with the help of these datas when a user gives a distress call we are able to decide the safest place nearby to him and give him the shortest route to the same.
Dijkstra Algorithm is to be used by us to predict the shortest route .

We also provide the user with updates on the relief operations and help the rescue team to know about the requirements and conditons of the people who have taken accomodatation.
