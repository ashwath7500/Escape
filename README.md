Our Idea is to develop a tech which helps the user to locate and reach the nearest secure place. Our plan is to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a place is safe during the natural calamity using the satellite image of the same place in real time. We also get inputs from users who update about their status, i.e whether they are safe or not. So with the help of these data, when a user gives a distress call we will be able to decide the safest place nearby to him and give him the shortest route to the same. We plan to deploy the Dijkstra Algorithm to predict the shortest route.
Using our tech people in heavily affected areas would be able to find a safe place to take refuge with the click of a button. The reliability of this functionality is to be ensured by
training a classification model with satellite images, to classify the place as affected or safe.
Also, every user can see the local distress calls. This feature improves the chances of a person in danger rescued to safety. Using this feature, a user can get to know whether their friends and family members are safe.
We also provide the user with updates on the relief operations and help the rescue team to know about the requirements and conditions of the people who have taken accommodation. Using this information, NGOâ€™s involved in the rescue operation can make required arrangements for food and other basic amenities.
We act as a platform between the rescue team and the people in the affected regions.
Through this technology, we aim to reduce the unwanted losses of lives due to carelessness and lack of information.
